# AdventuringToolbox
A python based excuse to learn regex and pythonic stuff.

Basically I made this to try to get some of the fucntionality from roll20, but for real life games. This is especially useful when your laptop is basically the only surface you have as a GM.

Run AdventureToolbox.py and use the prompt system. The inputs are not very smart yet, but they can handle decimals in the math portion (though not on a XdY roll, that has to be ints).
